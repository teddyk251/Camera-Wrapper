# Camera-Wrapper
This repo contains the Camera wrapper class and also its implementation. The wrapper class contains the openCamera method which
sets the deviceID to select the specific camera. It also contains the saveImage method which uses the readCamera method to read 
frame from camera and then saves it inside the project folder. When running the test program, the image window captures and 
closes once the Esc key is pressed.
